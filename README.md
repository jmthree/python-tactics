# python-tactics

A barely functional tactics-style combat game demo.

A ten year old school assignment being spruced up at the start of 2021.

A project which defies all reason in an age of great, open-source game engines.

## Running

### Setup
This project has been ported to Python 3.8+, as the most recent version of Pyglet only runs on version 3.5+ of Python. As a result, please ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed on your machine.

The project requires `pipenv` to install dependencies and run.
You can get started by installing pipenv with

```pip3 install --user pipenv```

Once installed, you can install all dependencies by running

```pipenv install```

From here, you can activate your environment with

```pipenv shell```

### Executing

Once set up, you can start the game from the repositories root directory with either

```./python-tactics```

or

```python -m python-tactics```

There is currently no difference between the entry points.
